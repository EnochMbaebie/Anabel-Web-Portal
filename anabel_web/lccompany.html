		<p style="font-family:Corbel Regular;">
		Our Local Content Strategy promotes the inclusion of all Local Content providers in production, operations, projects, vessels, drilling, engineering services, and well head engineering in Africa’s energy industry and in particular the oil and gas industry. In recognition of our efforts, we are currently working with the Nigerian Content Development and Monitoring Board as operator for the NCDMB’s Project Triple E designed to support the enhanced capacity and the development of special products, special skills and special groups within the oil and gas industry including but not limited to entrepreneurs, micro, small and medium scale enterprises as well as youths and women. The NCDMB’s Project Triple E is also targeted at supporting the financial structure of Nigeria Content companies; supporting the development of communities as well as the empowerment and training of youths. <br>

		The Anabel Group is working for the strategic positioning of locally manufactured goods and Nigerian oil and gas service companies that have been certified and are qualified Nigeria Content product or service providers. We are creating opportunities for partnership and encouraging the development of indigenous SMEs with the tenacity to take the Nigerian oil and gas industry to the next level. Our work with the Nigeria Content Development and Monitoring Board has exposed us to a very unique range of opportunities for Local Content providers which have not been exploited, largely because most Nigerian firms operating in the oil and gas industry have not yet seen the need to develop a comprehensive Local Content Strategy.  <br></font></p>

		<h4 style="font-family:Corbel Regular;">SUPPORT FOR LOCAL CONTENT MANUFACTURERS & SERVICES</font></h4>
      	<p style="font-family:Corbel Regular;">

We can extend that knowledge and expertise to supporting you directly to gain the skills to win some of the most sophisticated and lucrative tenders in the different energy markets of Africa and especially the Nigerian oil and gas industry.</font></p><br>
      	<h4 style="font-family:Corbel Regular;">FOSTERING JOINT VENTURE PARTNERSHIPS </font></h4>
      	<p style="font-family:Corbel Regular;">
      	With our network, we will match make you with international oil and gas companies and international original equipment manufacturers looking to meet their local content quota. In fulfilling our mandate to support the inclusion of local content, we will walk you through the process, develop your capacity, train your staff, and go the extra mile to ensure that you and your personnel have the sophistication and the skills required to consummate relationships with the international oil & gas companies.</font></p>

      	<h4 style="font-family:Corbel Regular;">PROJECT SUPPORT INSTRUMENT (FUNDING SUPPORT) </font></h4>
      	<p style="font-family:Corbel Regular;">In addition to Local Content business strategy, we also specialize in financial strategy, supporting you to raise international funding needed to support your local projects, which may include; IOC contracts, drilling operations, yard operations, production or fabrication facilities, vessel operations and equity partnerships to invest in acreage ownership </font></p>

      	<h4 style="font-family:Corbel Regular;">COMMUNITY CONTENT, YOUTH EMPOWERMENT, ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AND COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT STRATEGY </font></h4>
      	<p style="font-family:Corbel Regular;">
      		We currently support Nigeria Content Development and Monitoring Board community content, youth empowerment and community development schemes as part of our mandate to operate NCDMB’s Project Triple E and the Local Content Strategic Initiative. Our reach covers the six geopolitical zones in Nigeria especially the oil and gas communities. Project Triple E is focused on the promotion and development of Entrepreneurs, Employment and Empowerment, as its operator Anabel Group is your best partner in the industry for community content, youth empowerment, community environmental protection and community development programs. <br>
